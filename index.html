      <h3>My cubing journey</h3>
      <p>I began cubing in November of 2019. I instantly fell in love with all of the different things you could learn and my favorite event to practice is 3x3. Currently my personal best on 3x3 is 17.71 seconds. My main speedcube is the Rs3m 2020. I own over 20 cubes ranging from 2x2 to 7x7 and a lot of other different types of cubes.</p>

      <h3>Some of the best cubers can solve a 3x3 (Rubik's cube) in under 10 seconds! Two of the best Speed cubers in the world are Felix Zemdegs (left/top) and Max Park (right/bottom). My favorite out of the two is Max Park who has autism, his parents started taking him to competitions when he was young to improve his social skills and now he's one of the best in the world.</h3>

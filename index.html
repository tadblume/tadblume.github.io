          <h1>THE LOVE LANGUAGE OF THE UNIVERSE </h1>
          <p>Music is one of the most beautiful languages known to man, it is something that can bring out people's emotions through many different forms, some being nostalgia, romance, rage, or even sadness. Music is an art form that is displayed everywhere, from an old cassette tape to a record player to a small windup box and into the 21st century where online social media has made music accessible enough to enjoy throughout the entire world and played every single moment.</p>

        <h3>An Introduction</h3>
        <p>Speed cubing is a hobby/sport that involves solving the Rubik's cube or other twisty puzzles as fast as possible. People all around the world participate in competitions where they can meet other people who share their interest in speed cubing. </p>

      <h3>My cubing journey</h3>
      <p>I began cubing in November of 2019. I instantly fell in love with all of the different things you could learn and my favorite event to practice is 3x3. Currently my personal best on 3x3 is 17.71 seconds. My main speedcube is the Rs3m 2020. I own over 20 cubes ranging from 2x2 to 7x7 and a lot of other different types of cubes.</p>

      <p>Some of the best cubers can solve a 3x3 (Rubik's cube) in under 5 seconds! Two of my favorite speed cubers are Felix Zemdegs (left/top) and Max Park (right/bottom). Max park currently holds the 4x4 world record average as well as world record average for 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, and 3x3 one handed. Felix Zemdegs used to hold the 3x3 single world record of 4.22 seconds.  </p>

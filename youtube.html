          <p>Youtube is a website that allows users to upload their own videos, a lot of the content on youtube is music related. To discover new music you can simply search for a song, artist, album, etc. and it will show you results for what you searched. Searching for music also gives you music that may be related which means you can easily find new music related to the music you already like. You can use this website to search up anything you want, but  feel it would do best for music just because there is so much of it out there and you can find even more obscure music due to youtube letting anyone upload videos/music.  </p>

          <p>This is a very good website to discover new music because when you look up something that you want to listen to, it takes that information and it uses it to find other music that you might like. This applies for anything on youtube. You can use this website to search up anything you want, but  feel it would do best for music just because there is so much of it out there and it can narrow your choices down to only the music that you like.  </p>
